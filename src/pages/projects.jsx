          Thanks for visiting my projects page! I think that to truly get to know a person's work you have to see a little more than just a few pictures. In a perfect world, you'd actually get a glimpse into how their mind works. This page is my attempt to do that for myself so I have split it into two parts as follows:
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2 className="subHeader">Creations Showcase:</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Here you will find some previews to some of the work that I have done (at least what can be shared publicly), and some projects that I've made for fun to work on specific skill sets or tech stacks. Clicking on a preview will take you to a clean write-up of the created project and the who, what, where, when, and why of it. It should also include a Tech Stack breakdown where possible.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section className="previewList">
        { projects }
      </section>
      <h2 className="subHeader">The Whiteboard:</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Where the first section could be considered "show", this section is the "tell". If you want to get a closer look at how I think --and at my attempts to gain a better understanding of technology and crystalize said understanding to be able to teach it to others-- then this is the place to be. Here you will find the following categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrospective:</strong> Posts that reference <span className="label">Showcase</span> pieces and discuss honest introspection regarding pain points and things that I'd like to improve or expand upon in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deep Dive:</strong> In-depth posts where I go all-in to chosen topics in order to gain a deeper understanding. Initially I thought these would go under Blog Posts, but that should be reserved for shallower initial looks into topics. By the time I do a deep dive, it is likely that I will have engaged in various small projects for the sake of diving deeper so having a pre-defined place to post more extended content makes sense here.
            <br/>
            <p className="tldr">
              TL;DR: These should effectively be `Feynman Notes` of my studies in order to thoroughly crystallize the understanding of the topics I've covered.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section className="previewList">
        { whiteboard }
      </section>
    </PrimaryLayout>
